// The masthead's Rerun: re-derive the evidence a program can re-derive, and rebuild this
// page around it.
//
// It is the button for the loop this page is actually read in. A reviewer edits a test
// body, fixes a finding, adds a column — and until now catching the page up meant going
// back to the terminal the page was built from and remembering which of three commands
// refreshes what. Two of those three are wrong in a way nothing tells you: run the model's
// half again and the findings you are looking at are replaced by a different, equally
// fluent set at full price; run `--steps all` and you have just re-recorded the film.
//
// So this button asks for exactly one thing — `refresh-report.py --steps static` — and the
// server, not the page, decides what that means. The findings, the requirements matrix and
// the test catalogue are never touched: they are a judgement, produced once, when a human
// asks. Neither is the film: it is minutes long, it needs the application up, and it is
// the one artifact on this page whose re-recording is a decision.
//
// Hidden unless the probe says this server can honour it, like every other control here.
// A static copy has no process behind it to rebuild anything, and a button that copied a
// shell line instead would be offering the terminal round-trip this exists to remove.
//
// Since there are two of them, everything below is keyed off `data-rerun` rather than off
// an element id. The second button is the same machine with the model's half in front of
// it — `rerun-model.py`, then the same refresh with `--allow-model` — and the only thing
// that differs is the price, which is why the only thing the code below branches on is
// whether a button has a confirmation to show first. A copy of this block per button is
// how the free one and the paid one end up reporting failure differently.
